# Image-Searching App

A very simple image searching app that allows users to search for photos which they are interested in.
1. Used React controlled input and hooks (useEffect & useState) to allow users to input search terms.
2. Used Axios to make asynchronous request calls to the Pixabay API to fetch the search results.
3. Used React-Query to implement the infinite scroll feature and efficiently manage the asynchronous data.

## Script to Run the App: `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
